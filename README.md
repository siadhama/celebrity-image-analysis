# Celebrity Image Classifier

 Overview:
A face recognition web application that classifies celebrity images using computer vision and machine learning.
The app leverages OpenCV for face detection, wavelet transforms for feature extraction, and ML models (SVM, Random Forest) tuned with GridSearchCV.
The model is deployed via a Flask API with a custom-built web UI for easy image uploads and predictions.
